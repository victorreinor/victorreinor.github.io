#### Install Jekyll

Jekyll is a [Ruby Gem](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems) that can be installed on most systems.

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Install Jekyll and [bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#bundler) [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems)
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
3. Change into your new directory
```
cd personal-website
```
4. Install missing gems
```
bundle install
```
5. Build the site and make it available on a local server
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should see something like:

```
Configuration file: /octocat/personal-website/_config.yml
            Source: /octocat/personal-website
       Destination: /octocat/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
   GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.
                    done in 14.729 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/octocat/personal-website'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Don't worry about the "No GitHub API authentication could be found" message. [API authentication is only necessary](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/authentication.md) if you intend to display more detailed metadata, like a branch name.

6. Now browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
